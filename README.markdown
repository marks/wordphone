# WordPhone
## a WordPress plugin to add voice calling to your WordPress site

WordPhone provides a widget that you can add to your theme and allow visitors to simply click the button and call you directly or to call any voice application hosted on a service such as [[Tropo.com|http://www.tropo.com]].  Visitors *do not need any extra program* - the plugin uses [[Phono|http://www.phono.com/]] to launch the call *directly in the visitor's browser* using a Flash plugin.

The widget is skinnable so that you can make it fit with your theme and site.
