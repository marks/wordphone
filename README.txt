A WordPress plugin that allows you to embed a phone on your blog!

== Description ==

WordPhone provides a widget that you can add to your theme and allow visitors to simply click the button and call you directly or to call any voice application hosted on a service such as Tropo.com. Visitors do not need any extra program - the plugin uses Phono to launch the call directly in the visitor's browser using a Flash plugin.

The widget is skinnable so that you can make it fit with your theme and site.
