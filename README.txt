A WordPress plugin that allows you to embed a phone on your blog!

== Description ==

WordPhone provides a widget that you can add to your theme and allow visitors to simply click the button and call you directly or to call any voice application hosted on a service such as Tropo.com. Visitors do not need any extra program - the plugin uses Phono to launch the call directly in the visitor's browser using a jQuery plugin with a Flash component plugin. The widget is completely skinnable so that you can make it fit with your theme and site with standard CSS. 

[See installation instructions (or get the very latest version) on the github wiki site](http://github.com/marks/WordPhone/wiki "WordPhone plugin wiki")

**Note:** Problems may arise if your theme incorrectly loads a jQuery version prior to 1.4.X *statically* (which is not recommended by WordPress). If this happens, please contact your theme developer and urge them to read about how to load scripts with [wp_enqueue_script](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script).
